## Markdown
Cabin supports [GitHub flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) for its static site generation. It has awesome features like:

### Syntax highlighted code blocks
```javascript
function praise (thing) {
  console.log(thing + ' is so great!');
}

praise('Blok');
```
### Linked headers
Coming soon!
